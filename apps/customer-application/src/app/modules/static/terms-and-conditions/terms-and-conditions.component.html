<h3><b>Terms and Conditions</b></h3>
<br />
<h5><b>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></h5>
<p>
  The baskt service and all information, content, materials, products (including
  software) and other services included on or otherwise made available to you
  through the baskt service are provided by baskt on an "As is" and "As
  available" basis, unless otherwise specified in writing. Baskt makes no
  representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the
  operation of the baskt service, or the information, content, materials,
  products (including software) or other services included on or otherwise made
  available to you through the baskt service, unless otherwise specified in
  writing. You expressly agree that your use of the baskt service is at your
  sole risk.
</p>
<p>
  To the full extent permissible by law, baskt disclaims all warranties, express
  or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of
  merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Baskt does not warrant
  that the baskt services, information, content, materials, products (including
  software) or other services included on or otherwise made available to you
  through the baskt service, baskt's servers or electronic communications sent
  from baskt are free of viruses or other harmful components. To the full extent
  permissible by law, baskt will not be liable for any damages of any kind
  arising from the use of any baskt service, or from any information, content,
  materials, products (including software) or other services included on or
  otherwise made available to you through any baskt service, including, but not
  limited to direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, and consequential damages,
  unless otherwise specified in writing.
</p>
<h5><b> DISPUTES </b></h5>
<p>
  Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any BASKT Service, or
  to any products or services sold or distributed by Baskt or through Baskt.com
  will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The Federal
  Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
</p>
<p>
  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
  award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
  same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory
  relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of
  Use as a court would.
</p>
<p>
  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting
  arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Khalija Sweeney,
  2120 Company St. Christiansted, VI 00820. The arbitration will be conducted by
  the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the
  AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules
  are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all
  filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's
  rules.
</p>
<p>
  We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only
  on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative
  action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration
  we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may
  bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual
  property rights.
</p>
<h5> <b>APPLICABLE LAW</b> </h5>
<p>
  By using any Baskt Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act,
  applicable federal law, and the laws of the Virgin Islands, without regard to
  principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any
  dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Baskt.
